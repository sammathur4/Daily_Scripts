**What you’ll do:**

* Design, engineer, test, deploy, maintain, and improve current and future software
* Define standard practices
* Mentor Junior Engineers
* Review code for accuracy, efficiency, maintainability

**What we offer:**


Nothing is more important to our success than the team that built it. That’s why we provide benefits to keep you and your family well. Some of which we’re most proud to offer includes:

* Salary Range: $53,000 to $172,000
* 20 PTO (Paid Time Off) days + 10 paid holidays per year
