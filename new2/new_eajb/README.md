</details>

<details><summary> Would I get banned or my account be blocked? </summary>
<br>
No, since you run the bot on your own device and the traffic is coming from your own address, the risks of getting banned from any of the websites we support is very low. This is because you run the bot on your own device, your traffic will be similar with your own actions and the bot will act humanely meaning it will perform stopping waiting and skipping actions randomly. Meanwhile we dont recommend applying more than 200 jobs per day via job apply bot.
